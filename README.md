# StoneScript

This project contains small StoneScript automation scripts and supporting data I use to automate tasks, spawn or configure locations, and manage loadouts for Stone Story RPG. The files are plain text scripts intended to be run by the game's StoneScript interpreter (in-game console or external tooling that reads Stonescript files).

What this is

- A collection of StoneScript (.txt) scripts used for quick testing, level setup, and gameplay automation.
- Not a standalone project — these are helper scripts you run inside the Stone Story environment.

Contents

- `05_boiling_mine.txt` — automation/script for the Boiling Mine scenario (level 05).
- `loadouts.txt` — helper script(s) for setting or cycling player loadouts.
- `mindstone.txt` — script related to mindstone behavior or testing.
- `locations/` — folder containing scripted location setups by index:
  - `00_rocky_plateau.txt`
  - `01_deadwood_canyon.txt`
  - `02_caves_of_fear.txt`
  - `03_mushroom_forest.txt`
  - `04_haunted_halls.txt`
  - `06_icy_ridge.txt`
  - `07_temple.txt`
